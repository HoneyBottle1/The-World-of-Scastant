### Sandrial Canyon

The Sandrial Cliffs are large sandstone cliffs to the south of the world, within the Sultanate of Monaance. They suddenly rise up from the endless dunes of sand, tall in the sky. Many small paths wind through the treacherous terrain, falling and rising. On the western side, the cliffs reach the edge of the land and fall into the sea, slowly eroding the terrain with time. A village made up of archaeologists and miners was built along the walls deep within the ravines, in search of riches or knowledge. Rumors indeed talk of a hidden temple somewhere in the region, as old as the rocks themselves, but few are the ones who still seek it. The roots of the canyons are filled with copious amounts of valuable ores, sold in the whole world. Some people, in their search for adventure, climbed up the steep cliffside to reach the top, sometimes touching the clouds. From the reports of people who came back down alive, it is a vast and mostly flat land, with some vegetation, and active wildlife.
