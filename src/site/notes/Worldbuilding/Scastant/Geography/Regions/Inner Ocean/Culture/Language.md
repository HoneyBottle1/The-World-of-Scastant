# General Info
[[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Fauna & Flora/Fauna/The Thalenvael\|The Thalenvael]] have a language of their own, that developed through centuries of co-existence. This language is not spoken, as the Thalenvael communicate through the mind. This language was thus mostly used to write, to record history and artifacts, and to pass down memories and traditions to newer generations. 
This language is called Thalvaellin ("Thal" ("Sea") + "Vael" ("People"), "Lin" ("Tongue")).
# Grammar Rules

- Pronouns are based on the radical `-ab`.
	- Example : `"Me" = "Mab"`, `"You" = "Tab"`, etc...
- `m'` is used before words starting with a vowel.
	- Example : `M'Omotroi` ("A monster")
- `ma'` is used before words starting with a consonant.
	- Example : `Ma'Fdimit` (A fish)
- Sentence structure goes as follows: \[Subject]\[Object]\[Verb](\[Interrogative Word]).
- Interrogative words always go to the end of the sentence.
- Plural is marked with `-'em`.
	- Example : `Bigranan'em` ("Rooms")
- Every noun takes a capital letter.
- Negation is shown by adding `nen'-` before the word or verb that is negated.
	- Example : `Ebreimi nen'damai` ("Don't be" --> "Do *not be*")
- With the alphabet, words are separated by two spaces, and question marks and exclamation points are placed separately from the word.
- Nouns are made from the suffix `-vyn` added to the verb.
	- Example : `Dama` ("Be") becomes `Damavyn` ("Being")
- Adjectives are made from the prefix `mor'-` added to the noun or verb.
	- Example : `Lubya` ("Day") becomes `Mor'Lubya`
- Adverbs are made from the suffix `-'tan` added to the adjective
	- Example : 

TODO:
something for "-ing"
something for "co-"
something for inverse ("un-, "in", "dis-")
