Chaos Magic rejects structure entirely. It draws power from volatility, sacrifice, and instinct, producing results that cannot be repeated reliably. Mastery is a myth; survival is the closest equivalent.

Chaos Magic does not obey conventional laws, it is an anomaly of the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Earth]]. This reflects the political and societal instability of [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Ashenval/Ashenval - Overview\|Ashenval]], the region being gifted this power, as the land is constantly plunged in rivalry between clans.

Thus, it is quite difficult to know the full extent of what Chaos Magic can achieve, as the scholars who were once learned in its craft are now long gone and have passed into legend.
