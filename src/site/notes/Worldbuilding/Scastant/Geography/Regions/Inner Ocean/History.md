As the number of Thalenvael in the Ocean grew, they divided into large families, creating their own settlements and cities in different parts of the world. But as water kept evaporating, the families closer to the surface had to flee deeper. A large portion of the Thalenvael were able to escape to the greater oceans and live and prosper there. However, some of the more unlucky became trapped in valleys, to their doom.
One of these valleys would later become the Inner Ocean, the deepest region of continental Scastant. Together, the Thalenvael combined their genius and created the beautiful Sunken City, a marvel doomed to be their final resting place. 
As Humans thrived on the surface, the Sunken City received many trinkets and artifacts of old, thrown or accidently dropped into the Ocean. The Thalenvael found these objects remarkable, and collected them all in their grandest dome, including one of the three Forbidden Astras.
