Animation grants motion and intent to the inanimate, but never life. A blade may strike, a statue may walk, a door may obey ; yet none will dream, fear, or choose. Those who claim otherwise misunderstand the difference between movement and soul.

Animation is especially useful in delegating tasks to different objects for a period of time, although inanimate objects must always become inanimate again, and can never stay in a perpetual state of animation.
