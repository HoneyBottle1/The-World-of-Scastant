# The Inner Council
The Inner Council is a conglomeration of seven of the mightiest, wisest and strongest wizards, originally from all around the world, before only being chosen within the region of Everseen. 
It was originally created as a way to protect the population of the world from the abuse of Magic and its powers. They were the ones to create the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/History#The Creation of the Nexuses\|Nexuses]] and enact the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/History#The Laws on Magic\|Laws on Magic]].
