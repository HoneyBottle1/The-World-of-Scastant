Necromancy governs death’s aftermath, not death itself. It preserves, questions, or reanimates what has already crossed the threshold. The dead are not offended by this, but the living are.

Indeed, Necromancy is one of the few crafts that face the most critical and negative backlash from society. It was quickly banned with the Laws on Magic, along with [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Science & Magic/Magic/Types of Magic/Chaos Magic\|Chaos Magic]].
Many see Necromancy as unethical, vile, and an overall terrible act, which desecrates the memory of the dead.

Reanimating a soul into a dead body requires strength, but keeping them alive for long periods of time, and making them act on one's command requires absolute mastery. It is said that such act destroys the living just as much as the dead :

Although Necromancy was a gift given to the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|General Overview#The Concepts]] by [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Magic]] at the beginnings of [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Time]], the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Earth]] might still react when magic is used to undermine the balance of the world. Thus, the recent actions of the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Brantimek Empire/Brantimek Empire - Overview\|Brantimek Empire]] in the War in the East has further reinforced the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Earth]] response to [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Magic]] overuse in the world.
