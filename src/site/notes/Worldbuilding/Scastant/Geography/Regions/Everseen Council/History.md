# The Creation of the Nexuses

# The Laws on Magic

The Laws on Magic are a body of laws first written and published by the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/Government\|Inner Council]] in 435 **ER**. It was meant to impose limits and regulate the use of [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Science & Magic/Magic/Magic in Scastant\|Magic]] in the world, and to prevent magical catastrophes such as the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Valin Wastes/History\|Great Cataclysm]]. The original text contained ten articles, crafted in general fairness for everyone. But throughout the years, these laws were later amended multiple times, to allow for loopholes and more control from the Council.
