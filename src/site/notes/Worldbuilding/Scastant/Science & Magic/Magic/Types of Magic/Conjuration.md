Conjuration is the art of calling across boundaries. It draws forth that which exists beyond immediate reach: spirits, beasts, thought-forms, demons, and even those entities worshipped as gods. The conjurer does not create these beings, nor fully command them.
What arrives depends less on the spell than on what is willing, bound, or compelled to answer.

Conjuration magic was however greatly limited, through the regulations put in place by the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/History#The Laws on Magic\|Laws on Magic]], when the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/Everseen Council - Overview\|Everseen Council]] first came into power over 900 years ago.
