Shadow magic manipulates absence, be that of light, certainty, or attention. It hides, divides, and unsettles without ever fully revealing itself. Practitioners often forget whether they are concealed… or simply unseen by choice.

This type of magic is often used in stealth situations, when the wielder better remain unseen than go in a situation with force alone.
