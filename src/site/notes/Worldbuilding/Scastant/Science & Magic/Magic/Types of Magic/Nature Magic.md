Nature Magic is by far the one magic type working most hand in hand with the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/General Overview#The Concepts\|Earth]]. Its power comes from the ground itself, and everything that surrounds the wielder. Nature Magic, unlike most of the other magic types, is a relationship between the Earth and the person. 

Nature Magic controls living beings, but also the environment. Mastering this magic type, one can bend water and fire to his will, or grow roots from the ground, and much more.
