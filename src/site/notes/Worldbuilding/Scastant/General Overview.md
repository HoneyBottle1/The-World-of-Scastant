# General Overview
## Prologue
This document aims to explain the different aspects of the world of Scastant in a clear and concise manner. It shall go over all the major plot points, legends, systems and geography of the world. Please be advised that this document is highly unfinished, and that some points might be modified at any time.

I had made another document with a similar aim in the past, but it quickly branched off in many directions and became a bit difficult to understand. Yet, it still contains much information about descriptions of the different regions of the world, including the major cities, POIs and ideas for the region. There is also a timeline of events present in this document, though I have already modified some of the events present in that timeline, without updating it. If you wish to take a look at this document, here is the link : [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtuEeaK0v_rOu5uHhzCxFEBEbRgS4GDmdjrW937Ozts/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtuEeaK0v_rOu5uHhzCxFEBEbRgS4GDmdjrW937Ozts/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have any questions about specific events or how something works, please ping or DM me.

## The Concepts
In this world, there is no God or Devil, no Angels or Demons. What one would imagine as a deity here are Concepts. Out of Nothingness (or the Void), appeared before all else Magic as the most powerful concept. Later followed Time, Space, and finally, Life. These concepts are what created their respective domains:  
Space created the world of Scastant, and in this feat bore life to the Ocean (sometimes called the Sea by humans) and the Earth; and Life created all living beings, with the Plantae kingdom first (Fungi and Microbes too, if you want to include everything), followed by the Animalia kingdom. It is important to understand that these Concepts are thought to be alive and sentient.

## The Workings of Time
Time in this world is much similar to that of our Earth: Time is counted in seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, decades, centuries, millennia, ages, periods, ages, eons. Sixty seconds is a minute, sixty minutes is an hour, twenty-four hours is a day, thirty days is a month, twelve months are a year, a hundred years is a century, a thousand years (ten centuries) is a millennium.

Time is counted in two important eras: The Before Everseen Era (**BE**), and the Everseen Reckoning Era (**ER**). These two Ages are demarcated by one major event: The creation of the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/History#The Creation of the Nexuses\|Core Nexus]] by the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/Everseen Council - Overview\|Everseen Council]] (more on this later), represented by Year 0. Time in BE goes down to meet Year 0, while time in ER goes up away from Year 0. 

The current time in this world is 1225 **ER**. If this had to be compared to our world's time, I think it would compared to somewhere around the XVIth or XVIIth century, with some obvious different quirks.

### Seasons, Months and Calendars
Seasons are divided in two : The Dark Season and the Light Season. These two divisions are further separated into an Early, Medial, and Late season. Below are documented what months each season would correspond to, using our world's months. 

|            | Light Season       | Dark Season        |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Early**  | April - May        | October - November |
| **Medial** | June - July        | December - January |
| **Late**   | August - September | February - March   |
As dictated by the new calendar, appointed by the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Everseen Council/Everseen Council - Overview\|Everseen Council]], the days of the week are counted from the First day to the Seventh day. There are exactly 30 days in each month. Months of the year are counted from the First month to the Twelfth month, the first corresponding to our world's April. Indeed, in many people's view, this would mark the revival of the Earth and all its Life. 
## Of the Creation of Scastant
When Scastant was created, it was first entirely covered in one never-ending ocean. As Time passed, the water slowly evaporated, starting to reveal land. The first life forms to be born in this world were underwater plants and microscopic microbes. Over Time, more and more land emerged from the Ocean, and Life began to populate the Earth. As plants thrived everywhere, insects, and later, animals started evolving in both environments. Eons upon eons passed, and finally sentient creatures appeared first in water, then on land. For the Earth, it was the first Humans, and for the Ocean, it was the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Fauna & Flora/Fauna/The Thalenvael\|The Thalenvael]], a species of highly intelligent Sea Creatures. Their real name is unknown, and they are only called Thalenvael by the few Humans who believe they exist (more on that later). Through the centuries and millennia, water kept sinking lower, revealing evermore land, until present days. It is feared that water will keep disappearing until none is left in the whole world.
### Continents of Scastant
The most well-known and populated part of the world by far is the continental plateau Scastant, named after the world itself. The rest of the dry lands in this world are small and isolated islands. These include the original home of the [[Worldbuilding/Scastant/Geography/Regions/Homedons Northern Islands/Homedons Northern Islands - Overview\|Homedonians]], which had to travel to the continent of Scastant as overpopulation and lack of resources became a major issue.
This continental plateau is roughly 2,500km in length, and 1,115km in width, its area around 2,787,500km<sup>2</sup>.

![ScastantMainMap.png](/img/user/Worldbuilding/Scastant/ScastantMainMap.png)
On this map can be seen all 13 regions of this continent, along with most of the important points of interests. The scale of this map is 1:4,000,000. This means one centimeter on the map represents 40km in the world.
For measurements in the Minecraft in-game world, the scale becomes 1:41,600, where one centimeter on the map represents 0.416 thousand blocks in game (or 416 blocks).

This main continent hosts about 35 million people, which represents an average population density of 12.5 people/sq. km. But it is important to note that most of the population lives in small and remote villages in the wilderness. Indeed, only around 11% of the population of Scastant lives in urban centers, while the other 89% is spread unevenly in the rest of the land. This means only around 3.85 million people actually live in the few major cities spread in each region. And even then, the most populous cities rarely surpass 250,000 inhabitants.
